# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the recovery and reorganization of miscellaneous files (misc-*.js/ts/jsx/tsx) that were generated during VSCode recovery process. The system needs to intelligently analyze, categorize, and restore these files to their correct locations in the project structure while maintaining data safety and providing rollback capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely recover misc files from backup directories, so that I can restore my project structure without losing any important code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the recovery process starts THEN the system SHALL create a secure working environment with proper backup directories
2. WHEN copying misc files THEN the system SHALL preserve all original files in backup locations
3. WHEN creating work directories THEN the system SHALL establish separate folders for analysis, sorting, manual review, and final results
4. IF any step fails THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing backups without modification

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to automatically analyze misc files content, so that I can understand what each file contains and where it should be placed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing a misc file THEN the system SHALL examine its content using pattern matching rules
2. WHEN categorizing files THEN the system SHALL assign confidence scores for each potential category (components, pages, utils, hooks, api, styles, config, types)
3. WHEN generating analysis results THEN the system SHALL provide file previews and categorization suggestions
4. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a comprehensive report with statistics and recommendations

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to intelligently guess original filenames, so that I can restore files with meaningful names instead of misc-* patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining file content THEN the system SHALL extract function names, component names, and export patterns
2. WHEN suggesting filenames THEN the system SHALL use content-based heuristics to propose original names
3. WHEN multiple naming patterns exist THEN the system SHALL prioritize the most confident matches
4. WHEN no clear pattern exists THEN the system SHALL provide fallback naming based on file category

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to manually review and confirm file mappings, so that I can ensure critical files are placed correctly before final restoration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automatic analysis completes THEN the system SHALL present results for manual review
2. WHEN reviewing suggestions THEN the system SHALL allow modification of target paths and filenames
3. WHEN confirming mappings THEN the system SHALL validate target locations don't conflict with existing files
4. IF conflicts exist THEN the system SHALL provide resolution options (rename, skip, or overwrite with confirmation)

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to safely execute the file restoration process, so that I can recover my project structure with full rollback capability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN executing restoration THEN the system SHALL copy files to target locations without modifying originals
2. WHEN creating target files THEN the system SHALL ensure proper directory structure exists
3. WHEN restoration completes THEN the system SHALL provide a detailed log of all operations performed
4. WHEN rollback is needed THEN the system SHALL be able to restore the previous state from backups

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and reporting, so that I can track the recovery process and verify results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any operation executes THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp and details
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate statistics on file categories and confidence levels
3. WHEN restoration finishes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary report of recovered files
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for troubleshooting
