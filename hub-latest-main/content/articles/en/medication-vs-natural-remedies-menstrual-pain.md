# Medication vs Natural Remedies: Which Menstrual Pain Relief Method Is Right for You?

## Introduction

Facing menstrual pain challenges, modern women have unprecedented treatment options: from traditional medication to increasingly popular natural remedies. But how do you find the most suitable solution among numerous choices? This article, based on the latest medical research and clinical evidence, provides comprehensive comparative analysis and personalized selection guidance.

## Part I: Complete Analysis of Medication Treatment

### 1.1 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

**Representative Medications**:
- **Ibuprofen**: 400-600mg, every 6-8 hours
- **Naproxen**: 220-440mg, every 8-12 hours
- **Diclofenac**: 50mg, every 8 hours

**Mechanism of Action**:
NSAIDs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby relieving pain caused by uterine contractions. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, NSAIDs have an 80-85% effectiveness rate for primary dysmenorrhea.

**Advantages**:
- ✅ Fast onset (within 30-60 minutes)
- ✅ Significant effect, high pain relief rate
- ✅ Over-the-counter availability
- ✅ Simultaneous pain and inflammation relief

**Limitations**:
- ⚠️ Gastrointestinal side effects (stomach pain, nausea)
- ⚠️ Long-term use may affect kidney function
- ⚠️ Not suitable for patients with peptic ulcer or kidney disease history
- ⚠️ Potential drug interactions

### 1.2 Hormonal Medications

**Oral Contraceptives**:
- **Combination formulations**: Containing estrogen and progestin
- **Mechanism**: Suppress ovulation, reduce prostaglandin production
- **Effectiveness**: About 70-80% of women experience significant pain reduction
