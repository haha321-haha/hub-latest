# Complete Menstrual Preventive Care Plan: Evidence-Based Medical Guidance

*Evidence-based preventive care strategies for North American women based on the latest research from ACOG, NIH, and FDA*

Prevention is better than cure. Through scientific preventive care, menstrual experience can be significantly improved and pain and discomfort reduced. This guide, based on the latest research from authoritative medical institutions, provides comprehensive menstrual prevention management plans.

## I. Core Concepts of Preventive Care

### 1.1 Scientific Basis for Prevention Over Treatment

**Prostaglandin Regulation Mechanism**

Primary dysmenorrhea is mainly caused by excessive secretion of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α). These inflammatory mediators cause strong uterine smooth muscle contractions, triggering pain. Through preventive intervention, this physiological process can be regulated to reduce the occurrence and severity of dysmenorrhea.

**Evidence-Based Medical Support**

Multiple studies show that systematic preventive care can:
- Reduce pain intensity and duration
- Decrease dependence on pain medications
- Improve overall quality of life
- Reduce work and study interruptions caused by menstrual discomfort

### 1.2 Developing Individualized Care Plans

**SMART Principle Assessment**

| Dimension | Specific Goal Examples |
|-----------|----------------------|
| **S**pecific | Daily magnesium supplementation 200-400mg |
| **M**easurable | Use pain diary to record VAS score changes |
| **A**chievable | Set feasible goals based on existing lifestyle |
| **R**elevant | Develop strategies targeting personal main symptoms |
| **T**ime-bound | Set 3-month evaluation cycles |

**Personal Risk Assessment**

- Family history investigation (endometriosis, adenomyosis)
- Symptom severity assessment (0-10 pain scale)
- Lifestyle assessment (exercise, nutrition, stress)
- Previous treatment response evaluation

### 1.3 Cyclical Care Schedule

| Menstrual Cycle Phase | Main Care Focus | Specific Measures |
|----------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Menstrual Phase (1-5 days) | Pain management, nutritional supplementation | NSAIDs, iron supplementation |
| Follicular Phase (6-12 days) | Body recovery, exercise resumption | Aerobic exercise, vitamin supplementation |
| Ovulation Phase (13-15 days) | Symptom monitoring, nutritional reserves | Increase magnesium-calcium intake |
| Luteal Phase (16-28 days) | Preventive intervention, stress management | Anti-inflammatory diet, emotional regulation |

## II. Pre-Menstrual Preparation (7-10 Days Before)

### 2.1 Evidence-Based Nutrition Program

**Core Nutrient Supplementation**

Based on NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and clinical research evidence:

| Nutrient | Recommended Dosage | Mechanism of Action | Quality Food Sources |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Magnesium | 200-400mg/day | Muscle relaxation, reduces spasms | Dark leafy greens, nuts, whole grains |
| Omega-3 | 1000-1500mg/day | Anti-inflammatory, reduces prostaglandins | Deep-sea fish, flaxseed, walnuts |
| Vitamin B6 | 50-100mg/day | Neurotransmitter synthesis, mood regulation | Bananas, chickpeas, tuna |
| Vitamin D | 1000-2000IU/day | Immune regulation, bone health | Fortified foods, sunlight exposure |

**Magnesium Supplement Selection Guide**

Based on absorption rate and tolerance:
1. **Magnesium Glycinate**: Highest absorption rate, minimal gastrointestinal irritation
2. **Magnesium Citrate**: Moderate absorption rate, mild laxative effect
3. **Avoid Magnesium Oxide**: Low absorption rate, easily causes diarrhea

### 2.2 Anti-Inflammatory Diet Strategy

**Recommended Foods**

- **Omega-3 Rich Foods**: Wild salmon, sardines, flaxseed
- **Antioxidant Vegetables and Fruits**: Blueberries, spinach, sweet potatoes, pomegranate
- **Whole Grains**: Quinoa, oats, brown rice
- **Quality Proteins**: Legumes, nuts, lean meat

**Foods to Avoid**

- **Pro-inflammatory Foods**: Refined sugar, processed foods, trans fats
- **Excessive Caffeine**: Limit to under 200mg/day
- **High Sodium Foods**: Reduce water-sodium retention
- **Alcohol**: Affects hormone balance and sleep quality

### 2.3 Exercise and Physical Preparation

**Pre-Menstrual Exercise Program**

Based on American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommendations:

**Aerobic Exercise**
- 30 minutes daily moderate-intensity exercise
- Options: Brisk walking, swimming, cycling
- Intensity: Able to converse but slightly fatigued

**Yoga and Stretching**
- Specialized pre-menstrual yoga sequences
- Key poses: Cat-cow, child's pose, supine twist
- 15-20 minutes daily

**Strength Training**
- 2-3 times weekly light to moderate intensity
- Focus: Core muscles, pelvic floor
- Avoid high-intensity training 72 hours before menstruation
