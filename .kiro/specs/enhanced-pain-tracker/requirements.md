5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL generate medical summary with analytical insights
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include visualizations (charts and graphs) in the report
7. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL use the same design system as existing PDF resources for consistency

### Requirement 6: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user managing pain data, I want an intuitive and responsive interface, so that I can easily record and review my information.
