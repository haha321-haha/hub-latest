## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach
- Start with data layer (tasks 1-2) to establish solid foundation
- Build UI components incrementally (tasks 3-5) to maintain existing functionality
- Add analytics and visualization (tasks 6-7) as enhancement layer
- Implement export functionality (tasks 8-9) as final user-facing feature
- Polish with internationalization, accessibility, and performance (tasks 10-13)
- Ensure integration and quality through testing (tasks 14-15)

### Key Dependencies
- Chart.js for data visualization
- Existing PDF generation system for export consistency
- Next.js internationalization system
- Existing design system and components
- Browser localStorage API for data persistence

### Risk Mitigation
- Implement data migration system early to handle schema changes
- Create comprehensive backup/restore functionality
- Build error handling into every component
- Test with large datasets to ensure performance
- Validate medical terminology accuracy in both languages

### Success Criteria
- All existing pain tracker functionality preserved and enhanced
- Complete data persistence with no data loss
- Professional medical reports matching existing PDF center quality
- Responsive design working across all device types
- Full accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Comprehensive internationalization support
- Performance acceptable with large datasets (1000+ records)

This implementation plan ensures systematic development of the enhanced pain tracker while maintaining the stability and quality of the existing system.
